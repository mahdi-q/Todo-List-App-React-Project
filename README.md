## Key Concepts

This project explores several important concepts from the React library and JS:

- **State Management**: Using `reduxjs/toolkit` and `react-redux`, manage and centralize the applicationâ€™s state, making data consistent and accessible across components.
- **API Integration**: Utilize `axios` for making HTTP requests to external APIs, handling data retrieval, posting, and error management effectively.
- **Mock Backend for Development**: With `json-server`, set up a local REST API that serves mock data, which is useful for front-end testing without a full backend.
- **Data Fetching & Thunk Middleware**: Integrate asynchronous logic using thunks in `reduxjs/toolkit`, allowing you to fetch data with `axios` and store it in Redux for global access.
- **Error Handling**: Implement error-catching strategies for failed API requests or UI rendering issues, possibly by leveraging Redux to store error messages.

## Packages

Packages used in this project:

- **reduxjs/toolkit**: Simplifies state management in React with tools to reduce Redux boilerplate.
- **axios**: Makes HTTP requests and handles API calls easily in JavaScript.
- **bootstrap**: Provides responsive design components for building mobile-friendly UIs.
- **json-server**: Creates a mock REST API with a JSON file for quick backend prototyping.
- **react-dom**: Manages DOM rendering of React components in web applications.
- **react-redux**: Connects React components to the Redux store for efficient state management.
